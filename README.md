This repository is a thorough summary of Rice Univeristy's "Data Science and Machine Learning" graduate-level course in Industrial Engineering.

### What is Machine Learning?

Machine learning is the development of a computer program/system that has the ability to predict future data and make adaptations based on future observations. Machine learning is incredibly beneficial in simplifying tasks that would otherwise require extensive manual tuning and application of rules. When put into practice, machine learning can solve intricate problems such as:

- **Facilitating interaction:** Empowering chatbots with natural language understanding, enabling image and speech recognition for app interactions through voice commands.
- **Detecting anomalies:** Identifying instances of fraud, spam, hate speech, and even tumors.
- **Enhancing user experience:** Improving recommendations, search outcomes, notifications, and advertising personalization.
- **Optimizing content delivery:** Anticipating future actions to preload content, minimizing delays, visually summarizing complex data, and projecting future earnings.
- **Generating insights:** Analyzing data, evaluating feature importance, summarizing documents, and more.

### Course Description:

This data science course covers algorithms from supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and if time permits, reinforcement learning. We will implement many of the machine learning algorithms from scratch in python, but will also make use of, Scikit-Learn, Keras, and Tensorflow. Topics include, but are not limited to:

## Data Science Practices

- Python Programming
- Jupyter Notebooks
- Visual Studio Code
- Version Control with Git and GitHub
- Data Visualization

#### Supervised Learning

- Model Building and Error Analysis
- Linear Regression
- Gradient Descent
- Logistic Regression
- Neural Nets
- Support Vector Machines
- k-Nearest Neighbors
- Decision/Regression Trees
- Ensemble Learning

#### Unsupervised Learning

- k-Means Clustering
- Principle Component Analysis

#### Reinforcement Learning

- Tabular versus Deep Learning Methods

This repository contains notes on each of the ML topics as well as Jupyter Notebook files that explore datasets and apply each of the topics. Data science tools used in this repository include Python (versions 3.6 and above), pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, NumPy, and scikit-learn. The course also introduced students to powerful assistant tools such as ChatGPT, GPT4, and Github CoPilot.
