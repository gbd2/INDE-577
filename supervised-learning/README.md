## Supervised Learning

Supervised learning is a type of machine learning where the goal is to learn a mapping from inputs to outputs, based on a labeled dataset containing input-output pairs. In supervised learning, each example in the training dataset consists of an input data point (often represented as a vector of features) and a corresponding output label (also known as the target). The main task in supervised learning is to develop a model that can predict the output for new, unseen inputs based on the patterns it has learned from the training data.

Supervised learning includes *regression* and *classification*. More on this below:

### Regression vs. Classification

- **Classification:** The output variable is categorical. The goal is to assign the input into one of two or more categories. Examples include determining whether an email is spam or not spam, or identifying the digit shown in an image.

- **Regression:** The output variable is a continuous value. Examples include predicting the price of a house based on its features like size and location, or estimating the age of a person from their photograph.
